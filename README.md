## What is YPM?

YPM is a project management tool that automatically tracks the status of multiple projects in a specified directory.

**Key Features**:
- Automatic information collection from Git history and documentation
- Centralized management of all projects in a single file (`PROJECT_STATUS.md`)
- Progress visualization with multiple metrics (Phase, Implementation, Testing, Documentation)
- Next task identification for each project
- Flexible configuration via `config.yml`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signalcompose/YPM.git
cd YPM
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the onboarding wizard

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py
```

The wizard will guide you through:
- Setting the directory to monitor
- Configuring project detection patterns
- Setting activity classification thresholds

### 4. Update project status

Open Claude Code in the YPM directory and say:

```
Update project status
```

This will scan all projects and generate `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## How It Works

1. **Scans** directories specified in `config.yml`
2. **Collects** Git information (branch, commits, changes)
3. **Reads** project documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/)
4. **Generates** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with categorized project status

---

## Project Categories

- **🔥 Active**: Updated within 1 week
- **🎨 Planning**: In design phase (Phase 0)
- **🚧 In Development**: Implementation in progress
- **💤 Inactive**: No updates for over 1 month
- **📦 Non-Git**: Not a Git repository

---

## Requirements

- **Git**: For project information collection
- **Claude Code**: For project status updates (recommended)
  - [Get Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- **Python 3.8+**: For onboarding wizard

## Claude Code Custom Commands

YPM includes custom slash commands for quick operations:

### Project Management
- `/ypm` - Show welcome message and quick commands
- `/ypm-help` - Show detailed help with all available commands
- `/ypm-update` - Update project status (scan all projects)
- `/ypm-next` - Show next tasks for all projects in priority order
- `/ypm-active` - Show only active projects (updated within 1 week)

### New Project Setup
- `/ypm-new` - Launch interactive project setup wizard

**Usage**: Simply type the command in Claude Code, e.g., `/ypm-update`

---

## Project Bootstrap Assistant

YPM includes a comprehensive project setup assistant for launching new projects.

**What it does**:
- Guides you through project planning and requirements definition
- Creates proper directory structure with documentation
- Sets up Git workflow (Git Flow, Worktree support)
- Configures development environment (.gitignore, .claude/settings.json)
- Establishes documentation management rules (DDD, TDD, DRY principles)

**How to use**:

Simply run `/ypm-new` in Claude Code, or manually use the prompt:

1. Copy the contents of `project-bootstrap-prompt.md`
2. Paste into Claude Code
3. Follow the interactive wizard through 8 phases

See [project-bootstrap-prompt.md](project-bootstrap-prompt.md) for details.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yml` to customize monitoring:

```yaml
monitor:
  directories:
    - /path/to/your/projects    # Directories to monitor

  patterns:
    - "proj_*/*"                # Project detection patterns
    - "my-apps/*"

  exclude:
    - old_projects/*            # Exclude patterns

classification:
  active_days: 7                # Consider active if updated within N days
  inactive_days: 30             # Consider inactive if no updates for N days
```
